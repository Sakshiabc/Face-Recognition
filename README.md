Abstract: Attendance is a compulsory requirement of every organization. Maintaining attendance register daily is a difficult and time consuming task. There are many automated methods for the same available like Biometric, RFID, eye detection, voice recognition, and many more. This paper provides an efficient and smart method for marking attendance. As it is known that primary identification for any human is its face, face recognition provides an accurate system which overcomes the ambiguities like fake attendance, high cost, and time consumption. This system uses face recognizer library for facial recognition and storing attendance. The absentee's supervisor or parents are informed through email regarding the absence of their employees or wards respectively. The objective of this project is to innovate existing projects with some added feature like large data storage and fast computing through less hardware cost.
